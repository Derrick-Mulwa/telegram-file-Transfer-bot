# telegram-file-Transfer-bot
A telegram bot that directly transfers files and media from  users' mobile phones to my pc

After being faced with the challenge of having to use a physicall cable or various softwares(like xender) to transfer my files from my mobile phone to my pc, I developed a telegram bot that does that more easily and efficiently. all I have to do is send my file to my bot on telegram and, viola!, I have it on my pc. I can also getthe files from my friend's phone to my pc too. Just send that file to the bot, and it shall be transferred to my pc.

On a large scale, this system can be used as a back up database, or a ftp server to store files, but using telegram. I can also use this methodology to create an easy file sharing system in an office setup where collegues can send files to each other's pc directly without having to go to email and download directly.
